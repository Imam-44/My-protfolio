          Hello! My name is <span className="text-amber-300 font-semibold">Imam Hasan</span>, and Iâ€™m currently pursuing my Honours degree in <span className="font-semibold">Islamic History and Culture</span> at the University of Chittagong. My programming journey began in 2020 out of pure curiosity and the desire to create something meaningful. Since then, I have developed a passion for crafting modern, interactive, and user-friendly designs that not only look beautiful but also provide a seamless experience. Outside the world of coding, I am a football enthusiast, enjoying both playing and watching the game, and I love exploring new technologies, spending time with friends, and diving into creative hobbies. My ultimate goal is to continuously learn, innovate, and make a positive impact through my work, turning ideas into reality with every project I create.
